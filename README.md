## Demo 💻

## Description 🧐
Using test driven development (TDD), I made an application that allows the user to auto generate a webite that displays their team's contact details. The application will prompt the user for information about the team manager and then information about the team members. The user can input any number of team members, and they may be a mix of engineers and interns. This assignment must also pass all unit tests. When the user has completed building the team, the application will create an HTML file that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on the information provided by the user.
## Motivation 🚀
I wanted to explore TDD and also build a app can can display a team of people in an light hearted and gamified way
